To run the react native application install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on your IOSÂ or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. Scan the QR code from your terminal to open the project.


### Technology Stack
The technology stack was chosen based on the requirements and the analysis of the problem. The team has chosen to recreate the already existing iOSÂ application, but in a more modern and cross-compatible platform, [React Native](https://reactnative.dev).
React Native is a framework for developing a single mobile application for both iOS and Android using the same codebase.
The framework of the application is [Expo](https://expo.dev), the codebase is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is used as the backend for the project. 

Libraries: 
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org): Library to support the navigation between different screens in the application.
- [React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com): MaterialÂ design component library. 
- [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev): Style library to style the components with Tailwind CSS.Â
